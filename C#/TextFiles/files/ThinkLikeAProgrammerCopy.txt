01. Don’t Get Frustrated
02. 
03. The final technique isn’t so much a technique, but a maxim: Don’t get frustrated.
04. When you are frustrated, you won’t think as clearly, you won’t work as
05. efficiently, and everything will take longer and seem harder. Even worse,
06. frustration tends to feed on itself, so that what begins as mild irritation ends
07. as outright anger.
08. When I give this advice to new programmers, they often retort that while
09. they agree with my point in principle, they have no control over their frustrations.
10. Isn’t asking a programmer not to get frustrated at lack of success like
11. asking a little boy not to yell out if he steps on a tack? The answer is no. When
12. someone steps on a tack, a strong signal is immediately sent through the central
13. nervous system, where the lower depths of the brain respond. Unless you
14. know you’re about to step on the tack, it’s impossible to react in time to countermand
15. the automatic response from the brain. So we’ll let the little boy off
16. the hook for yelling out.
17. The programmer is not in the same boat. At the risk of sounding like a
18. self-help guru, a frustrated programmer isn’t responding to an external stimulus.
19. The frustrated programmer isn’t angry with the source code on the
20. monitor, although the programmer may express the frustration in those
21. terms. Instead, the frustrated programmer is angry at himself or herself. The
22. source of the frustration is also the destination, the programmer’s mind.
23. When you allow yourself to get frustrated—and I use the word “allow”
24. deliberately—you are, in effect, giving yourself an excuse to continue to fail.
25. Suppose you’re working on a difficult problem and you feel your frustration
26. rise. Hours later, you look back at an afternoon of gritted teeth and pencils
27. snapped in anger and tell yourself that you would have made real progress if
28. you had been able to calm down. In truth, you may have decided that giving
29. in to your anger was easier than facing the difficult problem.
30. Ultimately, then, avoiding frustration is a decision you must make. However,
31. there are some thoughts you can employ that will help. First of all, never
32. forget the first rule, that you should always have a plan, and that while writing
33. code that solves the original problem is the goal of that plan, it is not the only
34. step of that plan. Thus, if you have a plan and you’re following it, then you
35. are making progress and you must believe this. If you’ve run through all the
36. steps on your original plan and you’re still not ready to start coding, then it’s
37. time to make another plan.
38. Also, when it comes down to getting frustrated or taking a break, you
39. should take a break. One trick is to have more than one problem to work on
40. so that if this one problem has you stymied, you can turn your efforts elsewhere.
41. Note that if you successfully divide the problem, you can use this technique
42. on a single problem;
